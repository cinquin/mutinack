The way most correctness checks are performed for now is to grep the first few fields of each line of expected_output.txt in the output of the program.
See range_exploration directory for a test that compares the JSON outputs. Other tests should eventually be migrated to this mechanism, and/or compare the Java objects that are now returned to provide the analysis results (the set of objects produced by a full run of functional tests is serialized and saved to recordedFunctionalTestRuns.bin).
