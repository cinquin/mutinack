In this test Mutinack sees 3 duplexes. One should be ignored when it comes to the computation of allele frequencies at the position of interest, because it carries a disagreement. The other two duplexes have different numbers of strands but should have the same weight because allele frequencies are computed on a duplex-by-duplex basis. At the position of interest, a wt base and a deletion are present with equal frequencies of 0.5, and the disagreement should be reported as Q2 since minTopAlleleFreqQ2 is 0.5.
