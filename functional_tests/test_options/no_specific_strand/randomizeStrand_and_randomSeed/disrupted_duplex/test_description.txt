Test that randomizeStrand leads to incorrect grouping of reads into duplex strands (and accessorily check that randomSeed enables reproducible randomization, although if there was a problem in that area the present test would only fail at a very low frequency). With the particular seed used and the current Mutinack and JDK Collections::shuffle implementation, the reads are not assigned to the correct strand; the deletion disagreement is thus not detected. This test is implementation dependent; the seed might need to be adjusted if implementation changes.
