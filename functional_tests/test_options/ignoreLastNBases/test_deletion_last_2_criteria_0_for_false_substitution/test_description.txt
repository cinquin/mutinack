Make sure that last bases in reads are not used to call mutations. This option is useful in part because aligners can mistakenly report substitutions for reads that carry a small deletion at the end (option ignoreFirstNBases takes care of the beginning of the reads).  At the output loci, 1 Q1 duplex is expected to be detected in test sample and 5 duplexes are expected to be detected in control sample.
