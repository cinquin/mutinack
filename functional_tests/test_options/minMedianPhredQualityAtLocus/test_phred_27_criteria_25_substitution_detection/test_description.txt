Program is expected to detect mutation.  The median phred score is 27 (although there are enough reads with minBasePhredScoreQ2 >30 to call mutation) and  minMedianPhredQualityAtLocus=27.  At the output loci, 1 Q1 duplex is expected to be detected in test sample and 5 duplexes are expected to be detected in control sample.
