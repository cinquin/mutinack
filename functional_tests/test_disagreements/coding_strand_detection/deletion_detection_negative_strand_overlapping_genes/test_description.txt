Program is expected to detect strand disagreement for deletion but, since transcripts oriented in opposite directions overlap at that position, it cannot be determined whether the deletion occurs on the coding strand or on the template strand. Check that no coverage is recorded in the nPosDuplexQualityQ2OthersQ1Q2CodingOrTemplate statistic, because this transcript overlap occurs throughout the region that is examined.
